    aboutText: `## Project Overview

This is one of my favorite projects from my master's degree. For this project, I turned one of my hobbies, which is my love of history, into a small UI/UX app project. Because I wish there was an app like this when I was looking for history apps, I plan to make it available to the public when I am finished improving it.

Histopedia is my concept of a UI/UX app. It allows customers to search for any map of world history and then choose historical events based on the map they want to interact with and learn about. Users will also be able to learn about the historical events that other users have documented and will be able to contribute to the app by documenting historical events themselves.

## Outcome

Histopedia an appp  that transforms traditional historical archives into a modern, user-friendly experience that encourages exploration, learning, and community engagement while preserving cultural heritage.`,
